        I am Software Engineer based in Singapore, with experience in developing
        web applications and chatbots. I am interested in creating user-friendly
        applications and I am always looking for opportunities to learn and
        grow. When I am not coding, I am just a <Girl>girl</Girl>âœ¨ that wishes
        to be a stone in her next life.
