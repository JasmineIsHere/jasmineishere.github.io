    <p>Developer by day. Designer by night.</p>
    <p>
    I am a software engineer and I specialise in backend development. I am an INTP-T where I am naturally curious about the world around me.
    As the saying goes, "Curiosity killed the cat but satisfaction brought it back", I love learning and with new technology popping up every few days, the learning opportunities are endless! <br>
    I am also a designer where I have done a few marketing and illustrating gigs in my free time.
